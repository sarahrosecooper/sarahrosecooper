pronouns: (*she/her*)

> ♡ I'm actively looking for new opportunities 

[✨ portfolio ✨](https://sarahrosecooper.dev/)

> I am a passionately empathetic full-stack developer who is currently learning UI/UX. I am currently studying the Google Design UI/UX Certificate and I am a graduate of Lambda School where my focus was Front End Development. However, my dream stack is somewhere between UX Research and design-heavy front-end. 
> 
> I’m not ashamed to say my interest in technology was peaked in the early 2000’s when I picked up my first HTML/CSS for Dummies book so I could make my friends Myspace layouts (and my own) stand out. 😜
> 
> When I’m not developing or designing, my interests range from psychology, cats, film, music, all forms of art and literature/poetry to caffeine. After being a barista off and on for 8 years I find that my enthusiasm for people, diversity, and inclusivity for all human beings has and only will continue to magnify. Although these skill sets are not tech oriented, I have no doubt that they are directly transferable. *There is no greater motivating factor in my life* than fostering connection and warmth between all different types of people (animals, too.) I believe there is no denying that the internet is a central focus in making this happen. I hope as I expand my technical knowledge I can play a part in bridging this gap as a queer, woman of color. it’s riveting to be a part of an industry where ones hunger for knowledge can be endlessly satiated with a thousand ways to expand your skill set at any given moment.

##### ✔️ currently working on
